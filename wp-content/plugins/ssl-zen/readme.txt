= Why get a SSL padlock? =
1. Trust -Starting from July 2018, Google Chrome has begun to mark all non SSL-websites as ‘Not Secure’. When your users see the broken padlock, their trust wavers!

2. Security - SSL provides authentication, trust and compliance. If your customer is filling out forms, or making payments on your website, you need SSL to protect sensitive data from eavesdroppers.

3. SEO - Google ranks SSL-enabled websites higher than unsecured websites. Hence, securing your website also helps get you on top of Google’s search results.
